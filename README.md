# Wheelie Big and Small

Pitch: Infinite runner/driving game, where your vehicle's size is tied to your speed and you have navigate obstacles


## Game design

- Your vehicle's size is tied to your speed, the faster you go the larger you are
- But colliding into things cuts size in half! And makes you much slower
- Along with obstacles of varying sizes which enforce either minimum or maximum sizes, you need to adjust your speed accordingly and quickly enough


How do you lose/end the run?
- Hit a blocking obstacle of any kind (regardless of size)
  - Too small you get squashed by another car
  - Run into a barrier blatantly
- Reach a maximum-size limiting feature while too large
  - Tunnels and overpasses
  - Or you get too large and you get stuck off the road (maybe)
  - Speed bumps, except they don't end your run, but just nerf you down to a specific speed
- Reach a minimum-size limiting feature while too small
  - Cross a metal bridge that has grating that's too small and you fall into water
  - Ramp / jump, which have signage to indicate the minimum speed to make the jump "You must be [30mph/kmh] large to pass" etc
  - Tollbooth similar to the above

User inputs:
- Accelerate or brake (no reverse)
- Turn more left or more right; not full 360 turning control, more arcade leaning towards one side or the other (again, infinite runner style, see #DRIVE game)


Replay incentives
- Score for how far you got
- Maybe a time limit, so you can compare scores / compare your personal best
