# Wheelie Big and Small

An endless running game, where your character's size is tied to your speed and you have navigate obstacles


Just another endless runner? Well, hold onto your unicycle seat - because this one has a funky twist.  Your player's size is tied to your speed. Go faster to make it over sparsely slatted bridges, but slow down to fit inside tunnels and cross speed bumps. Size matters!

Reach the next checkpoint in time to get a time boost, and see how far you can push your high score!
